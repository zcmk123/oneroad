        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2013, the 18th by the third plenary session of the "the central committee of the communist party of China on comprehensively deepen reform certain major issue decision" clearly pointed out: "to speed up with neighboring countries and regional infrastructure interconnectivity, promote the silk road economic belt, maritime silk road construction, and form a pattern of all-round opening new." As a national strategy of innovation ideas, "One Belt And One Road" not only for China to realize national revitalization of the new scheme, as well as with the cooperation of countries along the development to build a new platform, the more the maintenance of world peace and development provides a new way of thinking.</p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing of the network information technology constantly reshape the social production and life, the Internet started to profoundly change the world economy and politics, to strengthen the construction of information service system and security become the inevitable trend of world development. In this context, information construction has become an important part of the One Belt And One Road initiative. Through perfecting China's route and the national information infrastructure construction and digital network service system, along the "One Belt And One Road" informatization construction aims to achieve information connectivity between countries, use digital "neighbourhood" all the way, for China itself and its participants is of far-reaching significance.</p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font color="navy">Take information as lead, drive network power construction</font></strong></p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "One Belt And One Road" informatization promotes the construction of domestic network economy space and service system, drives the construction of network power, and strengthens the security of cyberspace. Unbalanced regional economic development is the remarkable feature of the current China's economic development, through the "region" informatization drive is characterized by digital, intelligent, network economy with modern communication and information technology in the western region of high and new technology industry development, promote entrepreneurship and Internet information consumption, realize the informationization development of the economy. "Area" informatization construction and promote the network economy will become the western region overtaking "corner" of the new engine of economic development, to provide products and services for the local people effectively, make it more equally enjoy the information industry service and results.</p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the important content of national informatization development, "One Belt And One Road" informatization will come into effect with the Chinese government have broadband, big data applications and wisdom cities in China such as policy, jointly improve national Internet technology innovation ability, improve the network information service, the greater Internet gathered by the energy released, promote the construction of network power, to enhance China's notion of cyberspace and influence around the world.</p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Network security is the prerequisite and guarantee of realizing the power of the Internet. In July 2016, the general office of the central committee of the communist party of China, issued by the general office of the state council of the national informatization development strategy outline, points out that the "set up the correct network security concept, insist on the active defense, effective response to enhance the capacity of network security defense and deterrence, to safeguard national sovereignty, security, network space development interests." As the Internet social mobilization ability enhancement, hostile forces in the west with the aid of network to carry out the new subversion, under the situation of the field of network has become a local banking, land, empty, "frontiers" 5 days after, maintenance of network security is imminent. All the way through strengthening "area" informatization construction, will effectively promote the network infrastructure and development status in western China is relatively backward, enhance the consciousness of its network against external aggression and power, on China's "great firewall".</p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font color="navy">Based on the information, we will build an ecological chain of economic exchanges</font></strong></p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote the economic cooperation partnership with countries along the belt and road, we will build an ecological chain of connectivity and build a community of Shared future. In April 2016 at the 31st session of collective learning of the political bureau of the CPC central committee, xi jinping pointed out that general secretary "One Belt And One Road" construction should not only focus on their own development in our country, but in our country development as an opportunity to let more countries in the development of our country express, helping them achieve development goals. "Area" all the way through central Asia, South Asia, southeast Asia and other regions in Asia, connecting Europe and Asia and the Pacific economic circle, and through the information construction, building perfect network cooperation platform, will continue to deepen cooperation between China and countries along the network space, to promote national network infrastructure construction, eliminate information barriers between countries, to realize information resources across regions, interaction flow across national borders.</p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present in China, "Internet +" program, under the top-level design of electronic communications technology, computer technology and network technology as the representative of high and new technology constantly improve the business model innovation and industry upgrading transformation. All the way through the "region" informatization construction, the domestic emerging countries along the Internet enterprises will have more opportunities to develop in the industry innovation, resource sharing, such as cooperation, create common development, harmony filling of the economy, to achieve more social resources of energy release. At the same time, relying on the Chinese Internet investment fund and China's Internet development foundation, "One Belt And One Road" informatization construction will be carried out along the virtual economy and real economy cooperation between countries provide perfect hardware protection. As in the "area" strategic concept put forward in the second year, guangzhou has set up a "21st century maritime silk road" cross-border electric business platform, the formation of cross-border alliance, along with countries to carry out foreign trade, logistics, cooperation and exchanges in many aspects, such as economy, tourism, promote the development of electricity economy of participating countries.</p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><font color="navy">&nbsp;To reduce the "digital divide" between north and south by means of information</font></strong></p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will promote the construction of network projects in neighboring developing countries with information construction, narrow the digital divide with developed countries, and jointly adapt to the trend of global digital development. As an important part of the information revolution, represented by Internet digital has been the world within the scope of politics, economy and culture have significant influence on many aspects, such as, digital development is one of the important trend of current world development, is also a power to promote the development of globalization.</p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has always been an imbalance between developing and developed countries. In the digital age, the "digital divide" becomes a prominent manifestation of the "north-south imbalance" problem. "Neighbourhood" all the way along the countries of central Asia, west Asia and other regions of the country deep mainland hinterland, its in the aspects of network infrastructure, network talent resources are scarce, and the "resource gap" in its participation in the digital economy is low, it is difficult to from a growing "digital economy cake", thus further intensify the existing economic gap. At present, the developed countries such as the information society in the us and Europe index more than 0.6 generally, most of the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America are relatively backward, the uneven development of global information society, and this further deterioration in nearly two years.</p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of this "digital divide" also shows that the current developing countries still have market potential in the digital field. Therefore, countries along the One Belt And One Road have great cooperation potential and space in network facilities construction, high-tech development and network economic development. In 2016, with the help of "One Belt And One Road" information construction, the level of information society in the countries along the belt and road reached 2.78% year-on-year, higher than the global growth rate of 2.10%. "Area" of the development of the informationization to bring along the national network of new opportunity: the construction of the unique "information superhighway", provide the real cooperation between countries with the solid foundation of network information, the formation of the power of the linkage development, better in the tide of digital development of the world.</p>
        			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Area" informatization construction will share dividends and lessons for the construction of Chinese in cyberspace, at the same time promote along with the network development and construction of cooperation and dialogue on forming closer partnership in cyberspace, to narrow the "digital divide", jointly promote global digital process.
