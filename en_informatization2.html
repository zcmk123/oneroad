        				<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">"Area" was originated from the splendid Chinese civilization, arose in the connectivity of the Internet age, its construction is not only limited to realistic space, such as economy, culture, diplomacy in the field of mutual benefit and reciprocity, but should also include based on data information services, Internet business and international communication, and other fields, and information communication link connectivity in the field of information.</span></p>
        				<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">The construction of "One Belt And One Road" requires information first, and information construction is an important engine that drives the development economy of the countries related to One Belt And One Road.</span></p>
        				<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Today, I will follow the people BBS to see how the "information silk road" can help the construction of "One Belt And One Road".</span></p>
        				<p><strong>A、 Information and silk road: information-based "One Belt And One Road"</strong></p>
        				<p>On September 7, 2013, xi delivered a speech at nazarbayev university in kazakhstan, proposing the idea of jointly building the silk road economic belt. In October of the same year, xi visited asean to jointly build a "21st century maritime silk road". Together, these two constitute a major initiative of "One Belt And One Road".</p>
        				<p style="text-align: center;">
        					<img src="img/message3.png" class="img-responsive center-block" border="0" width="500" alt="一带一路" height="312" style="visibility: visible; opacity: 1; cursor: url(&quot;img/message3.png&quot;), pointer;">
        				</p>
        				<p>In march, 2015, to promote the implementation of the "area" all the way, let the ancient silk road, issue a new vitality to make mutually beneficial cooperation to a new historical height, the Chinese government, formulate and publish the drive and the silk road economic belt and the 21st century the vision and action of the Marine silk road ", which clearly put forward: "promote cross-border fiber optics communication mains network construction, improve the level of international communications connectivity, clear information of the silk road."</p>
        				<p>See "China's belt and road network" (the official website of "One Belt And One Road", which is sponsored by the office of "One Belt And One Road" construction work, as the guidance unit, the state information center.) The "information silk road" has been discovered by the small group.</p>
        				<p>The information silk road refers to the opening of a new type of international trade, which is based on communication and Internet industry. In the process of construction along the "area", along the national connectivity from the exchange of information, and connectivity is the network first, at the same time, should actively promote media sharing and win-win, on the resource exchange, personnel exchanges, business training to strengthen interaction, build multivariate, long-acting mechanism of exchanges and cooperation, open up a new prospect interconnectivity between media cooperation.</p>
        				<p>Thus, the "information silk road" is to accelerate the information construction of "One Belt And One Road".</p>
        				<p>In today's society, People's Daily work, consumption, entertainment, cannot leave the network services, in the tide of global towards the information age, "One Belt And One Road" along the country's connectivity more from becoming an information based society, to strengthen the construction of "area" of the information infrastructure, implement relevant countries in the data information services, Internet connectivity in the field of business and international communication, is the necessary requirement of construction along the "area".</p>
        				<p>Informatization "neighbourhood" all the way, can say to achieve along the national information and communication network connectivity, countries along the lower cost of access, narrowing the digital divide, make people from different countries sharing the dividends of "Internet +".

        				<p>"Area" initiative to implement the informatization construction, especially in fast perfect of network infrastructure, helps countries along the reverse passive situation of the "solo" in cyberspace, forming the discourse system of countries along the linkage of the construction of the power, to achieve "neighbourhood" all the way along the route of network control, effectively solve the unbalanced development in the field of Internet and irrational, imperfect rules, order etc, to build the common fate community network space, promote the network connectivity, Shared work space, and make great efforts to create a better future for human development.</p>
