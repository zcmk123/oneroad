        				<p>"Area" initiative puts forward three years, in both domestic and international has yielded fruitful results and positive influence, and the upcoming peak BBS "area" international cooperation will undoubtedly make "area" regional cooperation more closely.</p>
        				<p>In not long ago the scio central enterprises to participate in the "area" all the way to build case conference, director of the state-owned assets supervision and administration commission of the state council Mr Xiao said, "for more than three years, we are on a total of 47 enterprises, equity or investment, and the ' 'national enterprise cooperation all the way to build the 1676 projects. The construction and completion of these projects has promoted the development of local economic and social development and provided a rich practice for the "going out" of central enterprises. , for example, in the aspect of infrastructure construction, the central enterprises to play their own advantages, as in a large number of railway rail and high-speed rail projects, as a large number of highway and traffic facilities such as the karakoram highway construction, has brought convenience for local travel; Connectivity, the construction of cross-sea communication optical cables, land communication optical cables and communications networks and facilities have all contributed to the rapid development of the local information industry.</p>
        				<p>As "area" information in the builders of the silk road, China telecom, China mobile, China unicom three carriers in connectivity, lowering prices, investment cooperation, etc, comprehensive information help the setting up of the silk road.</p>
        				<p><strong>We will improve connectivity</strong></p>
        				<p>As the "One Belt And One Road" regional countries communicate more closely, they need a more powerful information highway to support them.</p>
        				<p>In terms of infrastructure construction, China mobile has built eight cross-border optical fiber optic cables in northeast Asia, central Asia, South Asia and southeast Asia through its self-built and cooperative model. The transmission capacity is 6270G. Five international cables will be built into the asia-pacific region and Europe. We have also built 29 information interaction nodes and five international communication and exit bureaus. Through these measures, China mobile has paved the way for information high-speed access to land, sea and sea routes, and improved connectivity and international business facilitation of basic communication facilities.</p>
        				<p>Among them, in the northeast Asia, central Asia, South Asia, southeast Asia's four big construction area around eight terrestrial cable, including: China and Russia (2) between China and Russia, China and Mongolia (Mongolia), China - kazakhstan (ha), China and India (India), Chinese, Vietnamese (Vietnam), zhuhai - macau (the zhuhai-macau) - Hong Kong, shenzhen (guangdong), land cable bandwidth of 6270 g. Built in article 5 of submarine cable, including the number one (- - new/SJC), asia-pacific ii (- - new/APG), and 1 gold (new - o/SMW5), xiamen (xiamen - Taiwan golden gate), light (fuzhou - Taiwan's fresh water), submarine cable bandwidth of 4300 g.
                        </p>
        				<p>In addition, China mobile has been strengthening its international communication capacity. In Beijing, Shanghai, guangzhou, shenzhen, fuzhou built five international communications gateway bureau, in the "area" built in 29 countries and regions along the "information station" (POP points, network service provider), to ensure the communication more convenient, more open communication.</p>
        				<p>China telecom has 67 overseas direct connection points (PoP) nodes and 13 overseas data centers; The two countries, including 12 of the 14 countries on the border with China, have completed the direct link of the land optic cables, with the establishment of four Eurasian express lines, with 35 cross-border land-line systems and 25T international transmission resources. The Internet exports about 5T, accounting for 58.5% of China's total export bandwidth. The network covers more than 60 countries and regions, and constructs a high-speed information channel of global integration. In the "One Belt And One Road" initiative, 11 strategic channels and 3 regional channels are covered in 12 channels, except for individual areas.
                        </p>
        				<p>At present, China telecom and Laos and Thai operators are working together to build the china-laos corridor, which is connected by sea rope from Hong Kong, mainland China, Laos and Thailand. After a decade of construction, the china-pakistan information corridor will make substantial progress this year. The silk road cable is a multilateral cooperation construction project spanning central Asia, South Asia and western Asia. China-myanmar meng-yin channel is a link between Bangladesh and India, which is the core construction of myanmar.</p>
        				<p>China unicom has increased connectivity with the non-mainland and adjacent seas, and jointly built the international sea and land cables with countries along the belt and road. China unicom has built a system for the construction of the china-myanmar international border cable system in the construction of economic corridors such as the china-south China peninsula and the bangladesh-china-india-myanmar economic corridor. Around the economic belt along the silk road in Russia, China and central Asia - economic corridor construction, in ascension to improve the traditional - - Russian - Europe, China - Russia - the direction of the Eurasian continental cable circuit based on capacity, performance, development direction of urumqi - central Asia, west Asia new road by the regional business bureau of inward and outward, promote the construction of urumqi support promoting economic corridor construction of the real economy.</p>
        				<p>Key direction, in coastal China unicom launched together with 19 countries and the area along the construction of Asian and European (AAE) submarine cable, 1 with 5 - Middle East - southeast Asia Western Europe (SMW5) submarine cable, first in the domestic operators form the double submarine cable covers the maritime silk route.</p>
        				<p><strong>The "One Belt And One Road" area of international communication cost a maximum of 97%</strong></p>
        				<p>In addition to enhance the capacity of "area" regional connectivity, three carriers after repeatedly cut international roaming charges, and in view of the "area" regional demand sharply lowered its international communication, the highest drop 97%.</p>
        				<p>Cut international communications, for example, China mobile has eight roaming, on May 1, 2017 full launch "area along one yuan" roaming charges, involving 64 countries and regions, international roaming voice lowered to 0.99 yuan/minute, 53 countries and regions, international roaming flow rate is adjusted for 30 yuan/day its unlimited 60 yuan / 90 yuan package, slashing the international direct dial at the same time.
                        </p>
        				<p>China telecom since May 1, 2017 to slash the international long distance call charges and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions, covering North America, Europe, southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and "neighbourhood" all the way along a total of 73 countries and regions, fell to 90% on average</p>
        				<p>China unicom lowered the price of "One Belt And One Road" in May to 0.49 yuan per minute in 25 countries and regions. In addition, China unicom has cut international roaming charges in the One Belt And One Road area in May, with data roaming in 19 countries, with the biggest drop of 97 per cent. Voice international roaming fee adjustment covers 17 countries and regions, with the biggest drop of 86%.</p>
        				<p>Starting in May this year, China unicom launched two "automatic upgrade" packages for different regions, covering 147 countries and regions. The package starts at 5 yuan and automatically upgrades to the top of 25 yuan /55 yuan per day, including 100MB/60MB of high-speed traffic and unlimited Internet access throughout the day.</p>
        				<p><strong>We will increase investment and cooperation</strong></p>
        				<p>While strengthening the communication capacity of One Belt And One Road and reducing the cost of communication, the three operators also speed up the establishment of institutions and invest more in "One Belt And One Road".</p>
        				<p>China mobile, for example, bought the company in Pakistan in 2007, CMPak, which set up its own company in Pakistan, and in 2014, it took a stake in TRUE, Thailand's only full-service telecoms operator. China mobile relies on simba to build a "china-pakistan information corridor". By strengthening the optimization, traffic management and brand building of basic network construction, it is the first to launch 4G wireless broadband service in Pakistan, which has led to the popularization and development of the mobile Internet industry. Sinmbarco has been operating locally, employing more than 3,200 local staff, of which Pakistani employees account for 99.3%. In 2011, simba won the presidential award in Pakistan.
                        </p>
        				<p>China unicom has provided include international roaming, data line, bandwidth wholesale, data center, cloud computing, mobile virtual operation (MVNO), system integration, a package of services, such as promoting regional international information application, outsourcing services, data center, call center and other related business development. So far, it has launched international roaming 4G services with 158 operators, covering 112 countries. Set up 10 wholly overseas subsidiaries and 21 offices abroad. In 2017, China unicom "neighbourhood" all the way along the route of Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, myanmar, Philippines, South Africa, India, kazakhstan, the united Arab emirates (uae) and 11 countries set up branches. In 2017, the "One Belt And One Road" regional investment accounted for 82% of China unicom's outbound planned investment projects.</p>
        				<p>China telecom planning, the next three to five years will spend their own money $1 billion for "area all the way along the" national information infrastructure interconnectivity and related countries, build communication with the "silk road" of the world.</p>
